# Tapered-Cooling-Fin-FEA
The main objective of this project was to keep the temperature rise in the cooling fin to the maximum of 100 degree Centigrade provided
that the ambient surrounding temperature was 0 degree Centigrade. It includes the generation of the MATLAB codes to determine the 
maximum temperature and heat flux distribution, study the convergence test by using the method of manufactured solution, perform mesh
refinement using the Richardson Extrapolation, and studying the convergence of all these solutions with solutions from FEA. Finally, 
determining the optimized value of fin converging parameter and it's height for minimum fin area for the same temperature difference.
The report contains all the generated MATLAB codes in the end.
